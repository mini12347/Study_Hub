Frank Sinatra's My Way was second in the UK vote with Monty Python's Always Look on the Bright Side of Life in third place. More than 45,000 people were surveyed by digital TV station Music Choice...The European chart, which included Denmark, France and Germany, put Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven in second and AC/DC's Highway to Hell in third. Queen's Who Wants to Live Forever was highly favoured by both UK and European voters...Both lists featured only one traditional or classic song each, with Britons requesting the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards' Amazing Grace and their continental counterparts opting for Mozart's Requiem. \\\"Wanting to share your most treasured musical gem with those you're leaving behind is the perfect way to sign off and leave a lasting impression,\\\" Music Choice music and marketing manager Simon George said.\",\n          \"Gerrard happy at Anfield..Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at Anfield and win trophies with the club...The 24-year-old England midfielder is determined to see out his contract, despite reported interest from Chelsea. He said: \\\"I'm signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. There's a lot of speculation but that's not down to me. \\\"As club captain all I want to do is help us get back up the table and into the Champions League again.\\\" Gerrard looked set to move to Chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to Stamford Bridge has again arisen, with the January transfer window approaching. He raised doubts about his Reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has insisted that Gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at Anfield. Benitez said: \\\"I said to Steven that I was sure he wanted to stay here and he said 'I do'...\\\"I then said to him 'Look, if you want to win titles, you want medals and you want Liverpool to have these things then I am going to need your help'. \\\"I really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him.\\\" Meanwhile, Gerrard has urged the Anfield board to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes in the January transfer window. Morientes, 28, has already expressed a willingness to come to England. Gerrard added: \\\"He's a great player. He scores goals in the league, in cup competitions and also in the Champions League. \\\"I don't think he'd be able to play for us in Europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him, we'd be getting ourselves a great player...\\\"He'd have Spanish coaches, a Spanish manager and we have got three or four Spanish players here now so they'll help him settle in. \\\"Rafael Benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he's got and if the right players become available at the right price I am sure we will strengthen. \\\"It would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in January to freshen things up.\\\"\",\n          \"Edgy Agassi struggles past Dent..Andre Agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the Australian Open with victory over Taylor Dent...The 34-year-old American, seeded eighth, made a poor start, dropping serve early on and later needing two chances to serve out the set. Having secured the lead, Agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks. But Agassi won the tie-break before wrapping up a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 win. Fourth seed..survived an injury scare as he battled past Mario Ancic 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. The Russian turned his right ankle in the third game of the fourth set and called for treatment immediately. But he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes...Ancic, Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push Safin all the way when he took the second set but Safin raised his game to sink the Croatian. Safin said he was trying to keep his temper under control at this year's tournament. The Russian hit himself on the head repeatedly in one second-set outburst but was otherwise largely calm in his victory. \\\"I try to stay calm because if you go crazy against players like Ancic, you might never come back because he's a tough opponent,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm a little bit calmer than I was before because I'd had enough.\\\" The Russian added that he was not worried by his ankle injury. \\\"I have had a lot of problems with that ankle before - it will be OK,\\\" he said...'s route to the fourth round was made easy when opponent Jarkko Nieminen was forced to retire from their match...The top seed and defending champion was leading 6-3 5-2 when Nieminen pulled out with an abdominal injury.

The world number one will play Cypriot..next after the former world junior champion beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 6-1. Federer admitted he was under extra pressure after extending his winning streak to a career-best 24. \\\"They are so used to me winning, but it's not that simple,\\\" he said. \\\"I had a feeling this could be a tough match. I had a bad start but I bounced back. I always want to play better than I am, but I thought I was pretty OK.\\\" French Open champion..is out of the tournament after a five-set defeat by Dominik Hrbaty. Hrbaty defeated the 10th seed 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-3 in a match lasting four hours and 21 minutes. The pair traded 16 service breaks during an exhausting baseline battle, with Hrbaty taking a decisive advantage in the eighth game of the final set.

There's a lot of speculation but that's not down to me. \\\"As club captain all I want to do is help us get back up the table and into the Champions League again.\\\" Gerrard looked set to move to Chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to Stamford Bridge has again arisen, with the January transfer window approaching. He raised doubts about his Reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has insisted that Gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at Anfield. Benitez said: \\\"I said to Steven that I was sure he wanted to stay here and he said 'I do'...\\\"I then said to him 'Look, if you want to win titles, you want medals and you want Liverpool to have these things then I am going to need your help'. \\\"I really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him.\\\" Meanwhile, Gerrard has urged the Anfield board to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes in the January transfer window. Morientes, 28, has already expressed a willingness to come to England. Gerrard added: \\\"He's a great player. He scores goals in the league, in cup competitions and also in the Champions League. \\\"I don't think he'd be able to play for us in Europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him, we'd be getting ourselves a great player...\\\"He'd have Spanish coaches, a Spanish manager and we have got three or four Spanish players here now so they'll help him settle in. \\\"Rafael Benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he's got and if the right players become available at the right price I am sure we will strengthen. \\\"It would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in January to freshen things up.\\\"\",\n          \"Edgy Agassi struggles past Dent..Andre Agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the Australian Open with victory over Taylor Dent...The 34-year-old American, seeded eighth, made a poor start, dropping serve early on and later needing two chances to serve out the set. Having secured the lead, Agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks. But Agassi won the tie-break before wrapping up a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 win. Fourth seed..survived an injury scare as he battled past Mario Ancic 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. The Russian turned his right ankle in the third game of the fourth set and called for treatment immediately. But he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes...Ancic, Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push Safin all the way when he took the second set but Safin raised his game to sink the Croatian. Safin said he was trying to keep his temper under control at this year's tournament. The Russian hit himself on the head repeatedly in one second-set outburst but was otherwise largely calm in his victory. \\\"I try to stay calm because if you go crazy against players like Ancic, you might never come back because he's a tough opponent,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm a little bit calmer than I was before because I'd had enough.\\\" The Russian added that he was not worried by his ankle injury. \\\"I have had a lot of problems with that ankle before - it will be OK,\\\" he said...'s route to the fourth round was made easy when opponent Jarkko Nieminen was forced to retire from their match...The top seed and defending champion was leading 6-3 5-2 when Nieminen pulled out with an abdominal injury. Federer had been in patchy form until then - mixing 19 unforced errors with 19 winners. The world number one will play Cypriot..next after the former world junior champion beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 6-1. Federer admitted he was under extra pressure after extending his winning streak to a career-best 24. \\\"They are so used to me winning, but it's not that simple,\\\" he said. \\\"I had a feeling this could be a tough match. I had a bad start but I bounced back. I always want to play better than I am, but I thought I was pretty OK.\\\" French Open champion..is out of the tournament after a five-set defeat by Dominik Hrbaty. Hrbaty defeated the 10th seed 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-3 in a match lasting four hours and 21 minutes. The pair traded 16 service breaks during an exhausting baseline battle, with Hrbaty taking a decisive advantage in the eighth game of the final set. Hrbaty will now play 2002 champion.., who outlasted American Kevin Kim 3-6 6-2 6-7 6-2 6-2.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2080,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"She said French, Jordanian and Nigerian nationals would be the first seafarers to get the new ID cards since their countries have already ratified the convention.The cards are due to be issued in February next year, in line with the revised UN Convention on Seafarers' Identity Documents of June 2003.\\\"It should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers.\\\"As holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric ID cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport.\\\"If you're issued a seafarer's ID in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed,\\\" Authenti-corp's CEO, Cynthia Musselman, told the BBC's Go Digital programme.The luxury cruise liner Crystal Harmony, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, is the unlikely setting for tests of biometric technology.\",\n          \"Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.But he said it was \\\"absolutely disgusting\\\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity.\\\"Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's \\\"chaotic\\\" asylum system under Tony Blair.Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's \\\"genuine refugees\\\".On Monday, Mr Howard said: \\\"It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\\\"Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans.\\\"If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,\\\" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council.People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,\\\" he said.The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than \\u00a33bn - or \\u00a3140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997.\",\n          \"\\\"I will be drawing on my experience of working with children and young people to help ensure that those with the power to improve children's lives do live up to their responsibilities.Education Secretary Ruth Kelly said Prof Aynsley-Green would \\\"strengthen the voice of children and young people\\\".Prof Aynsley-Green has also been the national clinical director for children in the Department of Health.\\\"I want all children and young people to know that they can approach me to discuss any matter that affects them, knowing that I will value their opinion.\\\"Great Ormond Street Hospital professor of child health, Al Aynsley-Green, was chosen by the government and will start the \\u00a3100,000-a-year job immediately.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"wordcnt_article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 235,\n        \"min\": 87,\n        \"max\": 4377,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 626,\n        \"samples\": [\n          165,\n          664,\n          188\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"wordcnt_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 108,\n        \"min\": 38,\n        \"max\": 2073,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 341,\n        \"samples\": [\n          310,\n          81,\n          168\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. However Nasdaq, an icon of the 1990s technology boom, recently poured cold water on those suggestions...The company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001. It technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the OTC Bulletin Board, which lists equities that trade only occasionally. Nasdaq will not make money from the sale, only investors who bought shares in the private placings, the filing documents said. The Nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential. It was the most potent symbol of the 1990s internet and telecoms boom, nose-diving after the bubble burst. A recovery in the fortunes of tech giants such as Intel, and dot.com survivors such as Amazon has helped revive its fortunes.\",\n          \"Saudi ministry to employ women..Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying...The move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. But progress has been slow, reports from the country say...Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had \\\"caused uproar\\\" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation \\\"a pitiful excuse for not employing women\\\". Women now make up more than half of all graduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. \\\"Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,\\\" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. \\\"I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.\\\"\",\n          \"Local net TV takes off in Austria..An Austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television...The people of Engerwitzdorf are filming, editing and producing their own regional news channel. The channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on PCs. The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere...\\\"It's growing unbelievably fast,\\\" said Rudolf Fischer, head of Telekom Austria's fixed line division. The trial of Buntes Fernsehen (Multi-Coloured TV) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based TV station run by the 8,000 residents of Engerwitzdorf. The hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by Telekom Austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers. Any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a Buntes Fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. In the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. \\\"They have adopted it very quickly,\\\" said Mr Fischer. \\\"They like the possibility to create their own content and see what's going on in the area.\\\" \\\"It's kind of the democratisation of local TV,\\\" he said, \\\"because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region.\\\" The Buntes Fernsehen project has been such a success that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria's online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC. Aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 420,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Manchester rock band Doves have entered the UK album chart at number one with their new release, Some Cities.Futureheads' cover of Kate Bush's Hounds of Love entered the chart at number eight, while Usher's Caught Up was a new entry at number nine.In the album chart, operatic quartet Il Divo's eponymous debut rose 23 places to number six, while crooner Tony Christie's Definitive Collection is a new entry at number 10, making it the highest-charting album of the singer's career.Hip-hop performer Akon's Locked Up is at number five, while hotly-tipped Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs have their second chart hit at number six with Oh My God.\",\n          \"Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying.The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation \\\"a pitiful excuse for not employing women\\\".\\\"I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.\\\"\\\"Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,\\\" Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying.\",\n          \"Sales in Dr Reddy's generics business fell 8.6% to 966m rupees.Profits at Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's fell 93% as research costs rose and sales flagged.Dr Reddy's has built its reputation on producing generic versions of big-name pharmaceutical products.The firm said its profits were 40m rupees ($915,000; \\u00a3486,000) for the three months to December on sales which fell 8% to 4.7bn rupees.Dr Reddy's Indian competitors are gathering strength although they too face heavy competitive pressures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Spanish drama Maria Full of Grace, about a Colombian woman who becomes a drug courier, got five nominations. Controversial biopic Kinsey, starring Liam Neeson as sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, was one of four films to get four nominations. The awards, now in their 20th year, honour quirky low-budget films, all of which must have a degree of independent financing. Sideways is written and directed by Alexander Payne, who directed the 2002 hit About Schmidt, winning Jack Nicholson his 12th Academy Award nomination...\\\"These awards, for better or worse, mean everything,\\\" said Sideways producer Michael London, adding they were a \\\"huge first step\\\" toward getting recognition from other awards. Among the other films receiving four nominations apiece were Brother to Brother, a drama about a young gay black man forced to live on the streets, Robbing Peter and Primer. Primer, a $7,000 (\\u00a33,650) tale of discovery, won top prize at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. Walter Salles critically acclaimed The Motorcycle Diaries and the forthcoming thriller The Woodsman, starring Kevin Bacon, received three nominations each. Also in the running, with two nominations, are high school comedy Napoleon Dynamite, The Door in the Floor and Garden State - written, directed and starring Scrubs star Zach Braff alongside Natalie Portman. The awards were announced by actors Selma Blair and Dennis Quaid in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\",\n          \"summarize: Lib Dems demand new inquiry..A judge should look into the David Blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the Lib Dems say...Sir Alan Budd's inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover's nanny. But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. He told BBC News: \\\"I'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. \\\"That must be bad for government, it must be bad for public confidence in the system.\\\"..Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. He said: \\\"There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that. \\\"So we do need to understand what took place and who was involved.\\\" The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged.

But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. He told BBC News: \"I'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. \"That must be bad for government, it must be bad for public confidence in the system.\"..Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. He said: \"There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that. \"So we do need to understand what took place and who was involved.\" The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged. But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.   \n",
              "1  summarize: Nissan names successor to Ghosn..Nissan has named a lifetime employee to run its operations after Carlos Ghosn, its highly successful boss, takes charge at Renault...As chief operating officer, Toshiyuki Shiga will run Nissan on a daily basis, although Mr Ghosn, who masterminded its recovery, will remain chief executive. Mr Ghosn is to become chairman and chief executive of Renault, which owns 44% of the Japanese carmaker, in April. Mr Ghosn transformed Nissan into a fast-growing and profitable business...Mr Shiga will nominally serve as Mr Ghosn's deputy. However, he will be Nissan's most senior Japan-based executive and will be in charge of the firm's global sales and marketing...He is currently in charge of Nissan's operations across Asia and Australasia and is credited with significantly improving its sales in China. He will inherit a strong legacy from Mr Ghosn, who has overseen a dramatic turnaround in Nissan's fortunes in the past five years. Dubbed 'le cost killer' for pushing through huge cost cuts in previous jobs, Mr Ghosn reduced Nissan's overheads by 20% and trimmed its workforce by about 200,000 after taking charge in 1999. These actions helped Nissan turn a 684bn yen ($6.4bn) loss in 2000 into a 331bn yen ($2.7bn) profit the following year. During his tenure, Nissan has increased its market share and made significant strides in key export markets. Nissan aims to increase vehicle sales to more than four million by 2008, launching 28 new models in the process...In his new job as Renault chief executive, Mr Ghosn will devote 40% of his time to Renault, 40% to Nissan and the rest to the group's activities in North America and other key markets...Mr Ghosn said Mr Shiga's appointment would ensure a \"seamless\" transition in management. \"I need a leadership team capable of accelerating the performance and delivery of results that has characterized Nissan over the past six years,\" Mr Ghosn said. \"I have full confidence in Toshiyuki Shiga and the new leadership team to help me implement the next chapter of Nissan's growth.\" Nissan also announced a number of other management appointments with promotions for several younger executives.   \n",

Murambadoro moved to Israel recently after a brief stint with South African club Hellenic. The club won the Israeli Cup final last season and are based in Sakhnin, which is near Haifa. The club have a strong ethic and are high profile promoters of peace and co-operation within Israel. The three other Africans at the club are former Cameroon defender Ernest Etchi, DR Congo's Alain Masudi and Nigerian midfielder Edith Agoye, who had a stint with Tunisian side Esperance.   \n",

The tour begins in San Diego on 28 March and will cover 13 US cities. The band will also play 24 European gigs, finishing in Lisbon in August...Mr Green said that ticket outlets had been \"bombarded\" by U2 fans. \"Unfortunately there's thousands and thousands of disappointed fans all over the country which is disappointing, but there's only two dates confirmed,\" he said. Many fans camped on the streets of the Irish capital for three days to ensure they were first in line at Ticketmaster in St Stephen's Green Shopping Centre, where the tickets went on sale on Friday. However the majority of tickets, priced at between 59.50 and 80 euro each, were sold online. Earlier this week, Bono announced that the band would play two shows at the venue, which holds almost 80,000 people, due to the phenomenal demand for tickets.   \n",

He said that high oil prices meant Opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in the second quarter. In London, Brent crude fell 32 cents to $49.74 a barrel...Opec members are next meeting to discuss production levels on 16 March. On Monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-month high as cold weather in the US threatened stocks of heating oil. US demand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this week, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year ago.
